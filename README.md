# Suspicious Email Submitter Outlook Add-in

The Suspicious Email Submitter is an extension for common web browsers and email clients that enables the user to easily submit a suspicious email with all the information necessary to a pre-configured destination for further analysis, such as a MISP instance or email address.

This project is hosted by the Computer Incident Response Center for Civil Society (CiviCERT), representing the needs of the at-risk communities Rapid Response Network member organizations serve. The extension will be built to be easily configurable for use by other organizations and communities both within and beyond these communities.
